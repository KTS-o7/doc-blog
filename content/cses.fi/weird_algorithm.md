Link to the problem: [Weird Algorithm](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1068)

## Intuition
This problem is a direct implementation of the algorithm described in the problem statement.

Given a number `n`, we need to apply the following algorithm:
1. If `n` is even, divide it by 2.
2. If `n` is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
3. Repeat the process until `n` becomes 1.

## Solution
```python
def weird_algorithm(n):
    while n != 1:
        print(n, end=" ")
        if n % 2 == 0:
            n = n // 2
        else:
            n = 3 * n + 1
    print(n)
```

## Geek fact
This is a famous problem in the field math called the Collatz conjecture.

Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that states that for any positive integer `n`, the sequence of numbers generated by the following algorithm will eventually reach 1.

So far, the conjecture has been verified for all positive integers up to 2^68.
