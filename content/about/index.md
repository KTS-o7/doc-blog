# About Me

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Krishnatejaswi S, a developer from Bangalore, India who's super into Generative AI, Langchain, and all that cool buzzy tech stuff. 

Interned at RingCentral then shifted to Onfinance.ai as a full stack developer.

I'm also a senior core member at Coding Club RVCE where I help mentor other students and organize coding events.

I've been tinkering around with Python, C++, React/Next.js, Streamlit, and AI frameworks like Langchain and Mirascope - basically whatever tools help me build nice things!

Some fun projects I've worked on include Portfolio-GPT (yep, built my portfolio website entirely with LLMs!), Better Bing Image Downloader (a Python tool that got 20+ stars on GitHub), and QuantQuips (a trading platform that even got featured at JPMC). 

I've also dabbled in research, writing papers about CNN algorithms for medical imaging and building an OCR system that boosted accuracy by 40%.

When I'm not coding, I'm usually reading about fiction, trying to outsmart the social media algorithms, or contributing to open source projects. 
drop a hi there if you see me around!
